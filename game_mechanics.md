# Game Mechanics

## Core Systems

### Echo Resonance System

#### Resonance Generation
- Players generate Resonance through their actions and choices
- Three primary types of Resonance:
  1. **Faith Resonance**
     - Generated through prayer, rituals, and devotion
     - Increases visibility of benevolent echoes
     - Can temporarily stabilize corrupted areas
     - Risk: May attract attention of powerful echoes

  2. **Doubt Resonance**
     - Generated through questioning and skepticism
     - Attracts corrupted echoes
     - Can reveal hidden truths
     - Risk: May accelerate corruption

  3. **Curiosity Resonance**
     - Generated through exploration and investigation
     - Creates unstable resonance fields
     - Reveals hidden echoes and paths
     - Risk: May trigger unpredictable events

#### Resonance Effects
- **Distortion**: Visual and auditory anomalies
  - Light refraction
  - Sound distortion
  - Reality warping
  - Intensity scales with Resonance level

- **Manifestation**: Echo appearances
  - Minor: Visual anomalies
  - Moderate: Partial manifestations
  - Major: Full entity appearances
  - Catastrophic: Reality breaches

- **Corruption**: Environmental changes
  - Structural decay
  - Reality fractures
  - Echo infestations
  - Permanent changes

# Echoes of Creation

A cosmic horror/mystery game where players navigate a shattered reality filled with divine echoes and corrupted forces.

## Core Concepts

### The Echoes
The world is filled with "Echoes" - fragments of the original cosmic order that manifest as powerful beings, corrupted divine forces, and warped realities. Players must gather, understand, and ultimately reconstruct these fragments.

### The Pillars of Reconstruction
Five core classes representing different aspects of the original order:

1. **The Covenant Weaver** (Abrahamic - Jewish Kabbalah)
   - Focus: Interconnectedness of creation through divine emanations
   - Abilities: Shem HaMephorash Severance, Divine Name Resonance, Qliphoth Seal

2. **The Philosopher-King** (Greek Mythos/Rosicrucian)
   - Focus: Knowledge and virtue as path to cosmic balance
   - Abilities: Philosopher's Stone Transmutation, Mind of Zeus, The Golden Age

3. **The Chakravarti Avatar** (Hinduism)
   - Focus: Divine warrior embodying cosmic order
   - Abilities: Dharma Shield, Cosmic Breath, Avatar's Strike, Prana Conduit

4. **The Serpent's Whisper** (Egyptian Mythology/Kabbalah)
   - Focus: Ancient secrets of creation
   - Abilities: Apophis' Shadow, The Scales of Ma'at, Serpent's Embrace

5. **The Jade Dragon** (Chinese Mythology)
   - Focus: Balance between Yin and Yang
   - Abilities: Dragon's Breath, Yin & Yang Shift, Qi Conduit

### World Aesthetic
- **Fractured Harmony**: A world assembled from remnants of different powerful civilizations
- **Chromatic Discord**: Shifting iridescent blues and greens
- **Echo Zones**: Distinct regions influenced by different mythological traditions
- **Ambient Soundscape**: Layered sounds with microtonal shifts

### Game Mechanics
- **Echo Resonance**: Core system where player actions generate Resonance
- **Resonance Types**: Faith, Doubt, and Curiosity
- **Echo Interaction**: Distortion, Manifestation, and Corruption
- **Player Progression**: Focus on managing Resonance rather than traditional leveling # chandari

# World Lore

## The Shattered Chord

### Historical Background
The world was once governed by "The Chord" - a civilization that worshipped the 'Prime Harmony', a fundamental principle believed to govern all existence. The Chord mastered the manipulation of Resonance, using it to shape reality and commune with divine forces. However, their hubris led to the "Great Dissonance" - a catastrophic event that shattered the Prime Harmony and unleashed the Echoes.

### The Great Dissonance
- A cataclysmic event that fractured reality
- Released the Echoes - fragments of the original cosmic order
- Created permanent reality fractures
- Corrupted the natural flow of Resonance
- Left the world in a state of "Fractured Harmony"
